Some play a major role when it comes to functionality others are helpful during development and some are useful after a site comes online.</p>\n<h2>Advanced Custom Fields Pro</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.advancedcustomfields.com\">Advanced Custom Fields Pro</a> plugin is in my opinion the best option to add meta fields to your posts and pages. The plugin offers a variety of field types for many use cases, let’s you define fields using PHP or save and read fields from JSON files.</p>\n<p>There are also a lot of other useful features, such as an easy interface to develop your own Gutenberg editor blocks without any React knowledge, a simple way to define and populate option pages and many useful filters to allow many customizations.</p>\n<p>Custom fields can be added to all post types (default and custom ones) as well as menus and menu items, option pages, taxonomies and more.</p>\n<p>Basic fields are available in the free version of the plugin. You can upgrade to the Pro version to get access to the repeater field, ACF blocks, the flexible content field, options pages, the gallery field and the clone field.</p>\n<h2>GAinWP</h2>\n<p>Adds Google Analytics tracking to your site and displays its data in your dashboard. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/ga-in/\">GAinWP</a> is free, easy to implement and works great out of the box.</p>\n<h2>Limit Login Attempts Reloaded</h2>\n<p>Increases the security of your WordPress site by limiting the number of login attempts that are possible through all login systems (normal login, XMLRPC, Woocommerce, custom login pages).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/limit-login-attempts-reloaded/\">Limit Login Attempts Reloaded</a> is free and provides many options for customization, such as the number of retry attempts per IP, logging, white- and blacklisting and supports custom IP origins (Cloudflare, Sucuri, etc.).

The plugin can be activated and configured per post type.</p>\n<h2>Quick Page/Post Redirect Plugin</h2>\n<p>Adds a redirect metabox to all pages, posts or custom post types with which the post can easily be redirected to any URL. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/quick-pagepost-redirect-plugin/\">Quick Page/Post Redirect Plugin</a> also provides an option for setting up redirects for non-existant links which is very useful after sites have been converted to WordPress or the link or page structure has been updated.</p>\n<h2>Safe SVG</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/safe-svg/\">Safe SVG</a> allows you to upload SVG into WordPress. The plugin checks uploaded files to stop vulnerabilities and gives you the ability to preview the uploaded SVG in the media library. This is included in the free version of the plugin and everything I need. If you want SVGO Optimization, Choose who can upload and premium support, check out the Pro version.</p>\n<h2>Simple Cache</h2>\n<p>An easy caching solution that just works. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-cache/\">Simple Cache</a> provides a one-click install with just an on-off switch.</p>\n<p>If you use advanced object caching (Memcached or Redis) there is an advanced mode available that will automatically setup Batcache and Memcached/Redis for you.</p>\n<h2>The SEO Framework</h2>\n<p>An automated, advanced, unbranded and fast SEO solution for your WordPress website. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/autodescription/\">The SEO Framework</a> describes itself as the only feature-complete SEO plugin that follows the white-hat guidelines and rules imposed by WordPress and search engines. The base plugin is free and provides all features you need.

It allows you to translate everything, adds language switchers automatically or provides filters and actions so they can be created manually. It also integrates with many other plugins (such as ACF, Yoast SEO, etc.).</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"My Most Used WordPress plugins","date":"October 26, 2020","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/wordpress-block-patterns/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"WordPress Block Patterns"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/gutenberg-gotchas/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Gutenberg Gotchas"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"fc97f3a9-06f0-52bb-81ed-d79d46fd2185","previousPostId":"46033069-4e64-51a9-902b-c6440ab057f3","nextPostId":"6bf208fb-f2fa-512f-8a4c-49c1856a5e2a"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1633425274","2841359383"]}
